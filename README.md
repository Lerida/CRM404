# CRM404
The idea of this project is creating a CRM for an Albanian company in the service sector that includes the processes of import , export and selling of goods. 

Simplicity and integration into daily routines are very important features. In order to make it easier for the workers to complete their dutties and for the managers to keep track of their workers, a CRM software is going to be developed.

Apart the CRM features, another important task of the software will be the inventory management of the products in CONAD stores. All the markets and the selling points will have access to the program to ask in time for products that are missing in the stores. On the other side the workers in the inventory department will get the requests from different stores and ensure that the missing products will be delivered on time or will let them know that for the moment they are out of stock.
